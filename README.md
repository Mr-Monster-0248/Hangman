# Python project-1

Wellcome to the github of the Project 1 in Python

The goal of this project is to design and implement the **Hangman** game</br>
This project is divided in three part:
  * Play with strings
    * Learn how to manipulate strings
  * Hangman game
    * The hangman game itself
  * Hangman game with GUI
    * An optional part to create the hangman game with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## I. Play with Strings
In the `List of word` file you will find some usefull functions to learn how to modify and interact with strings in **Python**

In the `Text File` file you will find some usefull function to manipulate file in **Python**

## II. Hangman Game

### Features
 * One player mode
 * Two players mode
 * Safe inputs
 * Not case sensitive

## III. Hangman Game with GUI

Work in progress

## IV. Features
Most functions contain _docstrings_ wich allow the user to have some help in the python shell by typing `help(functions_name)`

If you are using **Linux** you're able to use the makefiles to compute the program:
 * In the terminal make sure to be in the right file
 * Then use the `make` command
